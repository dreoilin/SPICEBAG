\section{Netlist Parsing} \label{sec:parse}
The \turmeric parser implements most of the functionality of SPICE network descriptions (netlists). This section describes it.\\

Netlists are a case-insensitive description of an analogue electronic circuit. Blank lines are ignored. Every other line in a \turmeric netlist is an individual entry and can be categorised as one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Title
    \item Element
    \item Analysis
    \item Directive
    \item Comment
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Title}
The title is always the first line of the file.

\subsection*{Elements}
\subsubsection*{Linear Elements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resistor}\\\texttt{R<string> n1 n2 <value>}\\
        \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} are the nodes\\
        \texttt{value} is a non-zero ohmic resistance
    \item \textbf{Capacitor}\\
        \texttt{C<string> n1 n2 <value> [ic=<value>]}\\
        \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} are the nodes\\
        \texttt{value} is a non-zero capacitance (Farads)
        IC VALUE
    \item \textbf{Inductor}\\
        \texttt{L<string> n1 n2 <value> [ic=<value>]}\\
        \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} are the nodes\\
        \texttt{value} is an inductance (Henries)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Independent Sources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Voltage Source}\\
        \texttt{v<string> n1 n2 [type=vdc vdc=float] [type=vac vac=float] [type=....]}\\
        \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} are the nodes\\
    \item \textbf{Current Source}\\
        \texttt{Current Source}\\
        \texttt{i<string> n1 n2 [type=idc idc=float] [type=iac iac=float] [type=....]}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Dependent Sources}
\texttt{n+} and \texttt{n-} are the nodes at which the source is imposed\\
\texttt{ns+} and \texttt{ns-} are the nodes at which the source is controlled\\
\texttt{value} is the proportionality factor

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{VCVS}\\
    \texttt{E<string> n+ n- ns+ ns- <value>}
    
    \item \textbf{VCCS}\\
    \texttt{G<string> n+ n- ns+ ns- <value>}
    
    \item \textbf{CCVS}\\
    \texttt{H<string> n+ n- <voltage\_source> <value>}
    \item \textbf{CCCS}\\
    \texttt{F<string> n+ n- <voltage\_source> <value>}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Non-linear Elements}

\subsection*{Analyses}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Operating Point}: \texttt{.OP}
    \item \textbf{DC Analysis}: \texttt{.DC}
    \item \textbf{Transient Analysis:} \texttt{.TRAN}
    \item \textbf{AC Analysis:} \texttt{.AC}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Directives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{End}: \texttt{.end}\\
    Forces parser to termination parsing the netlist. Anything after this line is silently ignored.
    \item \textbf{Initial Condition}: \texttt{.ic}
    \item \textbf{Include File}: \texttt{.include}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Addition of plotting directives depends on what waveform viewer we decide to implement}
\subsubsection*{Differences between \turmeric and SPICE netlists}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No subcircuit support
    \item No support for coupled inductors
    \item Various analyses not included: periodic steady state and pole zero analysis
    \item Some post processing functionality like \texttt{.PLOT} directives and fast fourier transform
    \item No support for line continuation
\end{itemize}
