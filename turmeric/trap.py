    **Returns:**

    tpl : tuple of tuples
        A tuple of two tuples.

        * The first tuple indicates what past values of the unknown are needed
          for the DF.
        * The second tuple indicates what past values of the unknown are needed
          for the prediction method.

        In particular, each of the sub-tuples is built this way:
        ::

            (max_order_of_x, max_order_of_dx)

        Where both the values are either ``int``, or ``None``.
        If ``max_order_of_x`` is set to an integer value :math:`k`, the DF needs
        all the :math:`x_{n-i}` values of x, for all :math:`0 \\le i \\le k`. In
        the previous text, :math:`x_{n-i}` is the value the :math:`x` array
        assumed :math:`i` steps before the one we are considering for the
        derivative.

        Similar considerations apply to ``max_order_of_dx``, but regard rather
        :math:`dx_n/dt` instead of :math:`x_n`.

        If any of the values is set to ``None``, it is to be assume that no
        value is required.

    The first array has to be used if no prediction is required, the second are the values needed for prediction.

        Each element of ``pv_array`` must be of the form:

        ::

            (time, x, derivate(x))

        In particular, the :math:`k` element of `pv_array` contains the values
        of:

        * :math:`t_{n-k}` (the time),
        * :math:`x_{n-k}`,
        * :math:`dx_{n-k}/dt`

        :func:`ahkab.trap.get_required_values`.

        Values that are not needed may be set to ``None``, as they will be
        disregarded.
    suggested_step : float
        The step that will be used for the current iteration, provided the error
        will be deemed acceptable.
    predict : bool, optional
        Whether a prediction for :math:`x_n` is needed as well or not. Defaults
        to ``True``.

    **Returns:**

    ret : tuple
        The return value has the form:

        ::

        `x_lte_coeff` is the coefficient of the Local Truncation Error,
